,KBResistance = Knockback Resistance.  This is how much the enemy will inherently resist getting knocked back/down by weapons.  Use mainly for really big guys.,,,,,
,XP & Bolt values are RELATIVE WEIGHTS -- actual bolt and XP reward is calculated by weighted average from the level pool (see Level config tab below).,,,,,
,"You can override the XP & Bolt calculation with an ABSOLUTE value by making the value NEGATIVE.  For example, an XP value of -1000 will always give a 1000xp reward, independent of the level pool size.",,,,,
