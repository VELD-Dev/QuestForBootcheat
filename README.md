# wtf is that ?
a fucking trainer to "cheat" with the Smuggler until the end of the game for now

## Where is the code of the cheat ?

Talk me calmfully, it's in `game/built/levels/npc_island/scripts/scene_smuggler.lua`.
* You have to know that the code works only BEFORE the ship-in-bay battle, it means that when Smug is in the lil' ship, the cheat-menu is not accessible anymore.  
What you have to do is just open Smuggler (strange) when he has nothing techincally to say you (like before the story of the crank-bolt, or after) and you it should open you a kind of dialog-menu.

## Why some folder are empty ?

Simply because these file are useless, or just non-exploitable.
