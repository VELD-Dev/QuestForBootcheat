,Special Note: Having to fake the numbers for some Bolt Pools and XP Pools as the levels are set up in such a way that doesn't play well with the economy,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,"Add as many levels as needed in the columns beyond E.  Be sure to label the level column in the yellow row marked ""Level"".",,,,,,,,
,"The ""Default"" level is used if the actual level cannot be found in this table.",,,,,,,,
,Level names in ALL CAPS are used in replay more,,,,,,,,
